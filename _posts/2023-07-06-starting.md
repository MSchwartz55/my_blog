> Love Godâ€™s people. Because we have come here and shut ourselves within these walls, we are no holier than those that are outside, but on the contrary, from the very fact of coming here, each of us has confessed to himself that he is worse than others, than all men on earth.

I started this blog to track my progress as I search for a place in the world. I currently spend most of my time vascilating between procrastinating and cursing myself for procrastinating. Although I feel more or less alright floundering about, I often wonder if I should refuse to participate in modern life and commit to asceticism in some imaginary, blissful monastery. I lack the gumption to act on that, or any, thought but hopefully this writing project gives me a better sense of direction.

Nice to meet you.
